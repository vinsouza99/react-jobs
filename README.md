This is a mock job seeking website for React developers that I made following Brad Traversy's YouTube video 'React Crash Course 2024'. It has all of the most basic React concepts (states, effects, routes, etc) as well as a simple backend with JSON.

I made this as homework of Langara College's Post-Degree Diploma in Web and Mobile App Design And Development
